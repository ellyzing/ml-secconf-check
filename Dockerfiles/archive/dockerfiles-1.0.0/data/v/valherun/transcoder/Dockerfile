# Install startup script  
# - executes required setup on startup  
RUN mkdir -p /etc/my_init.d/  
COPY init/Startup.sh /etc/my_init.d/  
RUN chmod +x /etc/my_init.d/Startup.sh  
  
# Drop in automation and services scripts  
RUN mkdir -p /transcoder-files  
COPY init/* /transcoder-files/  
  
# Now we need to setup access to required folders  
# /config is the folder that will hold our main transcoding script  
# - holds the automation scripts  
# - allows changes to automation without having to access docker  
#  
# /media/transcoder  
# - the holding spot for stuff you need to transcode  
#  
# setup folders within docker, but VOLUME links them to external
folders/drives  
VOLUME ["/media/transcoder", "/config"]  
  
# Use baseimage-docker's init system.
