# Docker image to build LyX using:  
# - Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)  
# - Qt4  
# - Autotools  
#  
# This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image containing a set of  
# tools and libraries that can be used to build LyX from source.  
#  
# The Docker image is primarily intended to be deployed on a  
# continuous integration (CI) worker, a.k.a CI node or slave. See the  
# end of this file for further details.

# Usage of Docker image  
#  
# The Docker image is intended to be used on a CI worker, typically  
# through a CI job on a CI server, where the CI job would e.g.:  
#  
# 1) Clone the source repository to a folder on the CI worker  
# 2) Start a Docker container (process), using the Docker image as a  
# template.  
# 3) "Bind-mount" the folder with the LyX source to the container,  
# making the folder and LyX source available to the container.  
# 4) Make the container run the script that builds LyX  
#  
# A Docker command to do the above is given at the end.  
#  
# When the build is done, the build script will exit and the container  
# will stop. The build results are then available to the CI worker in  
# the folder that was bind mounted.  
#  
# For troubleshooting the image, it's useful to start it in  
# interactive mode with a working terminal as follows:  
# docker run -i -t $IMAGE /bin/bash  
#  
# The rows below are suitable for the command section of CI job  
# (uncomment the last rows):  
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------  
#  
# With the source repository cloned to a folder $WORKSPACE, and  
# $IMAGE set to the name of the Docker image, the following will:  
# - Start a container based on $IMAGE with $WORKSPACE bind-mounted to folder
$C_WS  
# - Make the started container execute the script $C_SCRIPT to build LyX  
# Note: Docker automatically removes the container once the script exits.  
# C_BUILD=/build # Folder in container with build scripts etc  
# C_WS=$C_BUILD/workspace # Dest. in container for bind-mounted $WORKSPACE  
# docker run --rm -v $WORKSPACE:$C_WS $IMAGE $C_BUILD/build_lyx.sh $C_WS
